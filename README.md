#Project Description:
The goal of this project is to design and implement an Environmental Monitoring System using the C
programming language. This system retrieves real-time environmental data (e.g., temperature,
humidity) from a free API, processes the data, and provides notifications when predefined thresholds
are exceeded. Additionally, it incorporates automation via shell scripts for periodic data retrieval and
integrates modular programming practices through header files for enhanced readability and
maintainability.

#Libraries needed to install in linux
Libraries Used:
 libcurl: For HTTP requests and data fetching.
 cJSON: For parsing JSON responses.
 libnotify: For sending desktop notifications.
#Automation
